# 🚀 Smart Detection System using Sensors
## 📌 Project Overview
The Smart Detection System using Sensors is a project designed to identify specific individuals by analyzing 
their movement patterns using an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) and a Machine Learning model (LSTM).

This system is designed for use in an office to distinguish between the owner and visitors. It relies on a Raspberry 
Pi, which collects the data and sends it to an interactive dashboard for visualization.

## 🎯 Project Goals
✅ Design a sensor-based detection system
✅ Use artificial intelligence to identify individuals
✅ Store and analyze real-time data with MongoDB
✅ Provide a visual interface for tracking results

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
### Hardware: Raspberry Pi, HC-SR04 Sensor
### Development: Python (Flask, TensorFlow, NumPy)
### Database: MongoDB
### Machine Learning: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Neural Networks
### Dashboard: Flask, HTML/CSS, JavaScript

## ⚙️ How It Works
### 1️⃣ Data Collection

An ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) detects movements in the room
The Raspberry Pi records the data and sends it to MongoDB
### 2️⃣ Smart Identification

An LSTM neural network model analyzes the movement data
It distinguishes the owner of the office from visitors
### 3️⃣ Data Visualization

Results are displayed on an interactive dashboard
The user can view presence and identification statistics
📊 Use Cases
🔹 Office or restricted space monitoring
🔹 Automatic identification of individuals based on their movements
🔹 Real-time visualization of entries and exits

## 🚀 Conclusion
The Smart Detection System using Sensors is an innovative solution combining IoT, artificial intelligence, and real-time data processing.
This project demonstrates how sensors and machine learning can be used to improve identification and management of secure spaces.
